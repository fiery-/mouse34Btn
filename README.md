**mouse34Btn** lets you use your 3-th and 4-th mouse buttons to Copy (Cmd+C) and Paste (Cmd+V) in all Mac applications that support these commands. Itâ€™s very lightweight and is meant to replace Logitech Control Center LCC or BetterTouchTool which otherwise are good apps, but are too heavy. If you just want to Copy and Paste with your 5-button mouse (i.e. Logitech, Canyon, A4tech, etc.) or scroll with your trackball mouse, then mouse34Btn is for you.
