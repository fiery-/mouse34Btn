**mouse34Btn** lets you use your 3-th and 4-th mouse buttons to Copy (Cmd+C) and Paste (Cmd+V) in all Mac applications that support these commands. It’s very lightweight and is meant to replace Logitech Control Center [LCC](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/software/logitech-control-center-for-macintosh-os-x") or [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) which otherwise are good apps, but are too heavy. If you just want to Copy and Paste with your 5-button mouse, then mouse34Btn is for you.
If you're [X-Mouse Button Control](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm) user on Windows  and you're looking for a Mac alternative, then you’re in the right place.
